This is the source code for my personal website. It's built using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## IMPORTANT Note

This site is not created to be a template or theme, but for my own use.
However, I decided to make it open source in case anyone wanted to use it as a starter for their own personal website (or even use it as it is).  

Feel free to use the code, but keep in mind that I will not provide support or guidance for setting it up for you.
